## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores forecasting electricity usage using multiple models:

- **Statistical models**: ARMA / ARIMA
- **Deep Learning**: LSTM (planned)
- Handles trends, seasonality and exogenous features to improve forecast accuracy.
- Focused on informed energy management, grid planning, and sustainable resource optimization.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- **ARMA**: Autoregressive Moving Average model applied to historical energy data.
- **LSTM → planned**: Long Short-Term Memory networks for capturing long-range patterns.
- **SARIMA → planned**: Seasonal ARIMA to handle seasonality and time trends.

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements

Recommended environment: **Python 3.7+**

Install the dependencies:

bash:
pip install numpy pandas statsmodels matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
🚀 Usage Instructions
Prepare your data
Place times-series CSV (e.g., energy.csv) in the dataset/ folder.

Run the notebook
Launch Energy_ARMA.ipynb to explore the dataset, perform ARMA modeling, and visualize results.

(Optional) Extend the notebook

Train LSTM or SARIMA models

Incorporate features like weather, holidays, timestamps

📈 Results & Visualizations
ARMA performance visualizations are included in the Jupyter notebook.

Plots include:

Actual vs. Predicted values over time

Autocorrelation and residual diagnostics

🎯 Sample Output
Within the notebook, expect:

Coefficients summary of AR and MA parts

Forecasted vs. actual consumption plots

Error metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) & Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

📌 Next Steps
✅ Validate ARMA’s performance and tune its parameters

🧩 Build and compare LSTM and SARIMA models

📦 Develop a pipeline for automated evaluation and forecasting

🌐 Integrate with real-time forecasting systems or dashboards
